# Annex A

1. You should read first the "Read IDEAM.R" file which should read: the mosquitoes densities ("Densidad mensual. Nuqui. Mar 98- Abr 05.csv"); the malaria cases ("Monthly_Cases_and_Prevalence_Pf&Pv_Nuqui_January94_to_April05.csv"); the "ONI.R" index computed by the NOAA; and the "IDEAM.R" function to read IDEAM files containing climate records of Bahia Solano, Panamericana station ("Bahia Solano. IDEAM.   Todos") and Nuquí, Amargal station ("Todos diario, mensual por ano").

   If you have issues reading this files you can read the file "Analysis IDEAM 4_July_23_2017.RData" which already contains all this data.    Then, you should run the R script "Analysis IDEAM 4.R" to create the graphs presented in Annex A.

 2. The file "Nuqui_TRMM_CHIRPS.R" reads the file "Nuqui_TRMM_CHIRPS.csv" and was used to compute annual cycles of precipitation in Nuquí and Bahía Solano from TRMM and CHIRPS data.

 3. The file "Rainfall Annual Cycle Amargal & Panamericana.R" creates the annual cycle of precipitation in Amargal and Panamericana, two IDEAM stations.

 4. In addition scatter plots, seasonal plots, and cross-lagged correlations can be find in four excel spreadsheets.
