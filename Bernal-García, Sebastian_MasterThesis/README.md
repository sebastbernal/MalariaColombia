The Sebastian Bernal-García thesis developed a mathematical system dynamics model forced by air temperature to simulate the transmission of P. falciparum in an endemic region of the Pacific low-lands of Colombia (Nuquí, Chocó). To this end, different parameters and functions were estimated with field studies, and the use of computational techniques. Field studies helped to estimate the water temperature and the surrounding air temperature of a positive An. albimanus natural breeding site; and the the in situ daily survival probability of immatures forms of An. albimanus. 

Computational tecniques, on the other hand allowed to estimate parameters and functions as well. Iiterated filtering, a recently developed parameter estimation method based on a sequential Monte Carlo technique, was used the estimate sixteen unknown parameters. In addition, six relevant functions that represent the effect of constant ambient temperature on some life history traits of the immature and adult stages of An.albimanus were estimated using an ordinary least square method using unpublished data obtained in laboratory experiments and previously proposed non-linear functions.
